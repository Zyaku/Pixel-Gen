Pixel Gen

How it works:
- Generates random colors for neighbouring pixels
- 2 different patterns. 
- To switch comment out either model.updateIteratively() or model.updateConditionally() in the main method
- Click to erase already placed pixels
- If not all pixels are erased from the canvas, It will regenerate
